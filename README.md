# Health Tracker
## Project Overview
* To develop a single page app in Backbone that tracks the user's calorie intake, and optionally, other health-related metrics.
* Typing food names into the search field will display a list of matching foods as provided by the health API.
* Users will be able to select an item from the list, and the item will be added to the list of foods the user is tracking.
* The total calorie count will also update to reflect the new daily total.

## Installation and Running the Health Tracker App
Clone the GitHub repository and open index.html
